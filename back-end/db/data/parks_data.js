    title: 'Hyde Park',
    description: 'When King Henry VIII and his court were thundering across Hyde Park in 1536 in pursuit of deer and wild boar, it would have been difficult to visualise that years later the noble art of tai chi would be peacefully performed among the trees in the early morning, and the Italianate tenor of Pavarotti would echo across the park, applauded by vast audiences. Hyde Park was created to satisfy a royal passion for hunting. But over the years it became a place where people have pursued many other pleasures.',

The area was meadowland used for hunting and the occasional duel. The Green Park is now devoid of buildings and has virtually no artefacts, but it was not always so. The park once contained lodges, a library, an ice house and two vast "temples" called the Temple of Peace and the Temple of Concord.',

For most of the 18th century the gardens were closed to the public. They were opened gradually but only to the respectably dressed. In a long series of improvements Queen Victoria commissioned the Italian Gardens and the Albert Memorial.',
